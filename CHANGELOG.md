# elastic-apm-http-client changelog

# unreleased

- Fix config initialization such that the keep-alive agent is used all the
  time, as intended. Before this change the keep-alive HTTP(S) agent would only
  be used if a second call to `client.config(...)` was made. For the [Elastic
  APM Agent](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-nodejs)'s usage of this
  module, that was when any of the express, fastify, restify, hapi, or koa
  modules was instrumented.

  A compatibility note for direct users of this APM http-client:
  Options passed to the
  [`Writable`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_new_stream_writable_options)
  and [`http[s].Agent`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_new_agent_options)
  constructors no longer include the full options object passed to the
  [Client constructor](https://github.com/elastic/apm-nodejs-http-client/blob/master/README.md#new-clientoptions).
  Therefore usage of *undocumented* options can no longer be used.

## v9.5.1

- Fix possible crash when polling apm-server for config. Specifically it
  could happen with the Elastic Node.js APM agent when:

  1. using node.js v12;
  2. instrumenting one of hapi, restify, koa, express, or fastify; and
  3. on a *second* request to APM server *that fails* (non-200 response).
